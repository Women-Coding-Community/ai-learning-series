# Getting Started with WCC AI Learning Series

Welcome! This folder contains everything you need to set up your environment and get ready for the AI learning sessions.

> **2026: The Harness Series.** This year's live builds run on **Antigravity (IDE + CLI)**, **Claude Code**, and **Google ADK**, on top of the same GCP/Gemini foundation below. A pinned setup post goes up in [#ai-learning-series](https://womencodingcommunity.slack.com/archives/C09L9C3FJP7) about a week before Session 1, with a quick refresh ahead of Session 2. See [Tooling for 2026](#-tooling-for-2026-antigravity-claude-code-adk) below for what to install alongside the steps in this guide.

## 📦 One-Command Setup

### Step 1: Create `.env` File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs Session 1 essentials. Optional packages (alternative platforms, advanced features) are commented out - uncomment them if needed.

## ✅ Setup Checklist

Before Session 1, make sure you have:

- [ ] **API Key** - Gemini, Vertex AI, or alternative platform
- [ ] **Python 3.11+** - Installed and working
- [ ] **Virtual Environment** - Created and activated
- [ ] **Dependencies Installed** - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] **API Key Configured** - In `.env` file or environment variables
- [ ] **Test Script Passed** - Successfully called the API
- [ ] **IDE Set Up** - VS Code, PyCharm, or your preferred editor
- [ ] **Antigravity installed** - IDE + CLI, signed in
- [ ] **Claude Code installed** - CLI, signed in
- [ ] **Google ADK installed** - `pip install google-adk` (or per current ADK docs)
- [ ] **A clean local sandbox or repo** - somewhere you're happy for an agent to make changes

This is the "5-minute you're ready" checklist referenced in each session's setup post — if every box is ticked, you're set for the live build.

## 🛠️ Tooling for 2026: Antigravity, Claude Code, ADK

The Harness Series builds on top of the GCP/Gemini setup above, with three more tools layered in:

### Antigravity (IDE + CLI)

Google's agentic IDE and CLI. Used for Session 1's `AGENTS.md` / `SKILL.md` walkthrough and every live build after it.

- Install the IDE and CLI from the official Antigravity docs
- Sign in with the same Google account/project as your Vertex AI setup where relevant
- Verify with `antigravity --version` (or the current CLI entrypoint) in your terminal

### Claude Code

Anthropic's CLI coding agent. Sessions run the same skills across Antigravity and Claude Code to show portability.

- Install via `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` (or the current install method — check [claude.com/claude-code](https://claude.com/claude-code))
- Sign in and confirm with `claude --version`

### Google ADK

The Agent Development Kit, used from Session 1 onward to show that what you build travels into agent frameworks, not just chat tools.

- Install locally per the [ADK documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)
- Confirm your GCP project has the necessary APIs enabled (same project as your Vertex AI setup)

> **Stuck on any of these?** Ask in [#ai-learning-series](https://womencodingcommunity.slack.com/archives/C09L9C3FJP7) — each week's setup post covers the exact versions and gotchas for that month's session.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### API Keys

An API key is like a password that lets you use AI services. Keep it secret!

- ✅ Store in `.env` file (not in code)
- ✅ Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Regenerate if compromised
- ❌ Never commit to GitHub
- ❌ Never share in chat or email

### Virtual Environments

Virtual environments isolate your project dependencies.

```bash
# Create
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows Git Bash)
source venv/Scripts/activate

# Activate (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Deactivate
deactivate
```

### Environment Variables

Store sensitive data outside your code:

```bash
# .env file
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

Load in Python:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY')
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Python: command not found"

**Solution:**

- Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
- Or use `python3` instead of `python`
- Check PATH environment variable

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google'"

**Solution:**

```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

### "API key not valid"

**Solution:**

1. Get a new API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Update your `.env` file
3. Restart your application

### ".env file not loading"

**Solution:**

1. Make sure file is named `.env` (not `.env.txt`)
2. Place in project root directory
3. Call `load_dotenv()` before using variables
4. Install `python-dotenv`: `pip install python-dotenv`
